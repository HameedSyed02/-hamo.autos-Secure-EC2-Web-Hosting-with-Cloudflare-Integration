ðŸ“Œ Important Notes

**Cloudflare Origin Certificate**: This certificate is valid only between Cloudflare and your origin server (EC2). It is not trusted by browsers directly. Ensure that all browser traffic routes through Cloudflare to maintain secure HTTPS connections.

**Do Not Share Private Keys**: Never upload or expose your SSL private key (key.pem) in any public repository. Store it securely on your server with proper file permissions.

**DNS Propagation**: After updating nameservers on Namecheap, DNS propagation may take up to 24â€“48 hours globally. You can use tools like dnschecker.org to verify.

**SSL/TLS Mode**: On Cloudflare, ensure the SSL mode is set to Full (strict) to enforce end-to-end encryption with certificate validation.

**Firewall and Security Groups**: Your EC2 instance should only allow necessary ports:

22 â€“ SSH (consider using a VPN or IP restriction)

80 â€“ HTTP (can be optional if you force HTTPS)

443 â€“ HTTPS

**HTTPS Redirect**: Cloudflare settings such as "Always Use HTTPS" and "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites" ensure secure connections even if users type http://.

**Workers Debugging**: You can log or modify requests in your Cloudflare Worker to validate it's working correctly. Consider using console.log for debugging via the Cloudflare dashboard.

Cost Efficiency: Cloudflareâ€™s free plan provides generous limits, including 100k free Worker requests/day and free SSL/TLS features â€” ideal for personal projects or MVPs.
